        BMW SERIES1
    </h1>
<p>The BMW X5 has always been popular in the luxury SUV segment. Be it its looks or the manner in which it keeps the driver involved on the move. Recently, cheaper variants have made it to the line-up which inadvertently makes the X5 a more attractive buy.

<h1>BMW SERIES 2
</h1>

    <P id="H">A flamboyant expression of legendary BMW sportiness. A formidable epitome of advanced driving dynamics. All combined in a progressive coupé design with class-defining luxury. The BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé is much more than a conventional sports coupé. It is an irresistible driving force, inviting you to step out, stand out and do things your own way - in more ways than one.</P>
    <h2>DESIGN</h2>
    <P class="DESIGN">The BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé lends an extremely light appearance to authority on wheels of up to 18″ in size. The distinctive BMW kidney grille, LED headlights and rear lights, frameless doors, powerful shoulders and the sporty rear – sheer authority that is also reflected in the interior</P>
